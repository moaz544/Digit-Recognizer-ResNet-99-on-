# Digit-Recognizer-ResNet-99-on-
In this post, we will try the ResNet for image recognition. We will learn the Keras application tutorial for ResNet engineering from scratch. (Residual networks) is a deep neural network that is used as a backbone for many computer vision applications such as object detection, image segmentation, etc.

Distinguished by the ResNet syntax, a "shortcut" or "skip connection" allows for the gradient to be re-propagated directly to previous layers

# Identity Block

Identity block is the standard block used corresponding to the case where the input activation has the same dimensions as the output activation.

# Convolutional Block
We can use this type of block when the input and output dimensions donâ€™t match up. The difference with the identity block is that there is a CONV2D layer in the shortcut path.
