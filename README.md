In this post, we will try the ResNet for image recognition. We will learn the Keras application tutorial for ResNet engineering from scratch. (Residual networks) is a deep neural network that is used as a backbone for many computer vision applications such as object detection, image segmentation, etc.

Distinguished by the ResNet syntax, a "shortcut" or "skip connection" allows for the gradient to be re-propagated directly to previous layers
